            We provide mediation for family law cases including property division,child support and child custody in a respectful, culturally sensitive and caring environment. It is our practice to request proposals for parenting plans, child support and division of assets and liabilities from each party prior to the mediation to allow for adequate preparation prior to the meeting. We do shuttle mediation (each party in a different room) unless requested to do otherwise. Our clients settle in mediation almost all the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our estate planning practice begins with a discussion of the clients goals in drafting wills and trusts with consideration of the impact on the survivors and tax implications of the approach the client wishes to take. We also discuss powers of attorney and directives to physicians (advance directives) to achieve a secure and well planned future. Our services take into consideration any cultural norms that need to be addressed as well as potential pitfalls related to specific family issues and gifts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prenuptial agreements, unmarried couple agreements and post nuptial agreements are addressed with the very specific issues and assets of each case. What works well for one couple may not be appropriate for another. Our services make sure that each prenuptial agreement, unmarried couple agreement or post nuptial agreement takes into consideration the life style of the parties and their financial goals as well as the assets and debts. There is no one size fits all for these agreements.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this time I work with two young and highly competent attorneys to provide the divorce, parenting plan and parentage services.

                Helene has been representing our family for years and is the best family law attorney I have ever worked with. She helped us with custody issues that ensured the safety and security of my two young nephews. If she hadn't been there for us these loving brothers likely would have been separated and placed into the instable homes of their irresponsible fathers.
