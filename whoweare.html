            As a mediator and wills, trusts, and estate planning attorney, it is my goal to provide legal services to families in a manner appropriate to their lifestyle. My practice provides a friendly and welcoming environment to families in a way that is respectful and appropriate to their ethnic, religious and sexual orientation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 1990 my practice has focused on family law in all its aspects as well as wills, trusts, and estate planning. I graduated from the University of Washington School of Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been on both sides of the mediation table, as a mediator and as the attorney for my clients. I have mentored law students and new attorney's in the area of family law and have served as adjunct faculty at the Seattle University School of Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to practicing law, I was a literature professor for fifteen years, with a graduate degree from the University of Chicago. I also have a strong background in medical ethics and psychology and have served on boards and advisory committees of several institutions addressing such issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mediation is a voluntary process whereby a qualified neutral third party assists the disputing couple in reaching a mutually agreeable and reasonable solution to their identified issues. The mediator’s role is to facilitate the discussion, provide options, and assist in defining and clarifying issues and examining and evaluating options. The mediator does not make decisions but assists the couple in reaching an agreement that best fits the couple’s particular circumstances and situation within the confines of the law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although not all mediations are successful, a successful mediation is generally cost effective, time efficient, and allows the couple to remain in control of the process and the solutions. Participants tend to be more satisfied with the results of a mediated agreement than a court-imposed decision and there tends to be less re-litigation, particularly around parenting issues.
