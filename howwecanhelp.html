                      Ginger and Scott had briefly lived together and had a 5 year old boy at the beginning of the case (6and a half at the end). Scott was approximately 35 years older than Ginger. Scott moved out shortly after the child was born and saw the child periodically, usually with little notice to the mother that he wanted to see the boy. The boy did not know Scott was his father. At these visits, Scott usually brought an overabundance of toys (gifts) and was very impatient with the boy. The boy had been thrown out of three pre-schools for behavior issues. He also acted out extensively at home. Scott repeatedly harassed the mother with irrational demands but not at a level rising to a basis for an anti-harassment order.
